## Project Motivation

Nostalgia. there was a time when the web was full of abstract experiments showcasing what possible with canvas/JS or CSS. I wanted to keep that alive and see those experiments on a Home Assistant dashboard.

Known as digital oblivion. Some of the experiments I have saved overtime in my bookmarks have long been lost or forgotten because of the passage of time. Occasionally I would save these to disk. A number of experiments only exist here now because of this. 

I have tried my best to find references and credit the artists who's original work has been lost to digital oblivion, archive.org links provided if they are available - This is not always the case.

### License 

This project is compromised of the works of various artists each either their own licensing terms, none of this projects license are imposed. Copyrights are preserved respectively. 

For this reason, code belonging to this repo (bg-annimation.js) uses CC BY-NC 4.0 Deed Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International.

Code inside Gallery carries the Licenses and Copyrights of their authors respectively. 

### Usage

Minimal config

```yaml
type: custom:lovelace-bg-animation
background:
  - id: 13.ribbons-two
```

All config

```yaml
type: custom:lovelace-bg-animation
delay: 20000
redraw: 200000
gallery:
  type: local
cache: false
style: "css"
sequence: random, shuffle, name_desc, name_asc, id_asc, id_desc,
background:
  - id: 13.ribbons-two
    cache: false
    style: "css"
    parameters:
      background-image: 222
```

### The package.yaml 

Everything is self contained inside package.yaml. Instead of embedding plain HTML files I wanted structure and provide a basic templating ability. 

It allows for better offline support for those who use Home Assistant offline only. 

Raw HTML/CSS/JS code can als be generated this way.

### Submitting to gallery

I accept contributions. Because Javascript is allowed, you must be a reputable user on Github. Submissions need to also be attached to an issue that contains the following info:

- Image Preview
- name: description: author: source: 
- Does the package contain any of the following?
 - - Javascript,
- -  Uncompiled code like pug, scss
- Have you audited the code yourself?
- Is it safe?

Security is the primary requirement, any code that looks to be obfuscated in any way will not be approved. The reason behind this is Home Assistant by nature has a large attack surface. Third party unaudited code presents a big risk.

We will take steps to minimize risk.
