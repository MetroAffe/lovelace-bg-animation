## Project Motivation

Nostalgia. there was a time when the web was full of abstract experiments showcasing what possible with canvas/JS or CSS3. I wanted to keep that alive and see those experiments on a Home Assistant dashboard.

Some of the experiments I have saved overtime in my bookmarks have long been lost or forgotten because of the passage of time. Occasionally I would save these to disk. A number of experiments only exist here now because of this. 

I have tried my best to find references and credit the artists who's original work has been lost to digital oblivion, archive.org links provided if they are available - This is not always the case.

## Usage

Minimal config

```yaml
type: custom:lovelace-bg-animation
background:
  - id: 13.ribbons-two
```

All config

```yaml
type: custom:lovelace-bg-animation 
delay: 20000 # Delay in milliseconds between background changes
header: # CSS styles for the header
  transparent: true
  style: | # CSS can be applied to the Lovelace header
      background: transparent;
gallery: 
  type: local # Specifies the type of gallery, 'local' means the gallery is hosted on the same server
cache: false # Speeds up rendering time, this option disables it globally
style: | # Applies CSS to parent root container
    color:white;
sequence: random, shuffle, name_desc, name_asc, id_asc, id_desc, # Specifies the order in which backgrounds are displayed
background: 
  - id: 13.ribbons-two # Background ID (Found inside gallery/packages/[foldername])
    cache: false # Speeds up rendering time considerably, this option disables it globally
    style: "css" # Applies CSS to the parent container
    redraw: 200000 # Time in milliseconds after which the background is redrawn
    parameters: # Parameters can be passed into a background, depends if author has added support 
      background-image: 222 
```

### Offline mode

Offline mode was a core design feature, by default the plugin connects to this repos Github page. You can override this by using the below.

```yaml
gallery: 
  type: local # Specifies the type of gallery, 'local' means the gallery is hosted on the same server
```

This will tell the plugin to load everything from Home Assistant only. It's also useful if you wish to develop and test your own packages too.

### The package.yaml 

Everything is self contained inside package.yaml. Instead of embedding plain HTML files I wanted structure and provide a basic templating ability. 

It allows for better offline support for those who use Home Assistant offline only. 

Raw HTML/CSS/JS code can als be generated this way.

### Submitting to gallery

I accept contributions. Because Javascript is allowed, you must be a reputable user on Github. Submissions need to also be attached to an issue that contains the following info:

- Image Preview
- name: description: author: source: 
- Does the package contain any of the following?
 - - Javascript,
- -  Uncompiled code like pug, scss
- Have you audited the code yourself?
- Is it safe?

Security is the primary requirement, any code that looks to be obfuscated in any way will not be approved. The reason behind this is Home Assistant by nature has a large attack surface. Third party unaudited code presents a big risk.

We will take steps to minimize risk.
