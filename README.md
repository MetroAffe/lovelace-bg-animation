## Motivation

Mostly for nostalgia. I remember the awe of abstract web experiments when Canvas/JS/CSS3 was new. I wanted to preserve some and view them like art pieces on my Home Assistant tablet/dashboard, they make great backgrounds!

Some of the experiments I have saved in my bookmarks overtime have long been lost or forgotten because of the passage of time. Occasionally I would save these to disk. A number of experiments only exist here now because of this. 

I have tried my best to find references and credit the artists who's original work has been lost to digital oblivion, archive.org links provided if they are available - This is not always the case.

## Install

You can install this plugin two ways: 

### Option 1: HACS 

Click this button which automatically downloads this plugin. [![Open your Home Assistant instance and open a repository inside the Home Assistant Community Store.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/hacs_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/hacs_repository/?owner=ibz0q&repository=lovelace-bg-animation&category=Plugin) 

If the above button dos not work then:  

Open HACS -> Frontend -> Custom Repositories -> Paste into Repository "ibz0q/lovelace-bg-animation" -> Category -> Lovelace -> Click "Add". 

Click the Explore & Download Repositories button and search for "Live Background Animations" open and click Download.

### Option 2: Manual 

Download the latest release zip. Extract the contents of dist into a folder inside www: homeassistant\config\www\lovelace-background-animation

***Files should be placed so they exist like this:***
```
homeassistant\config\www\lovelace-background-animation\
homeassistant\config\www\lovelace-background-animation\dist\
homeassistant\config\www\lovelace-background-animation\dist\bg-animation.min.js
...
```

Finally go to your Lovelace dashboard, click Edit -> Manage Resources -> Add resource -> URL: /local/lovelace-bg-animation/dist/bg-animation.min.js -> Javascript Module and click Create.

---


That's it, if you have a valid configuration (see below). You should see a background animation immediately.


## Usage

Config needs to be placed inside Lovelaces config file, you can do this inside the Lovelace UI > Edit mode > Raw Configuration Editor.

### Minimal Configuration (To get started)

```yaml
bg-animation:
  duration: 60000 # Global duration of each bg
  header: # Sets the header transparent (Optional)
    transparent: true
  background:
    global: # Add and remove as required
      - id: 11.space
      - id: 13.cyber-lights
      - id: 15.sound
      - id: 7.rainbowness
      - id: 27.tron
```
### Full configuration options
` * = Optional `

```yaml
bg-animation: 
  duration: 5000 # * Duration of the animation in milliseconds (global)
  redraw: 200000 # * Time in milliseconds after which the animation should be redrawn
  style: | # * Change the default style of root container holding iframe (This can cause bugs if original style is not applied)
      background: transparent;
  gallery: # *
    type: local # Type of gallery, "local" | "remote" 
  header: # *
    transparent: true # If true, the header of the page will be transparent
  cache: false # * If false, nothing will not be cached. Default is true
  sort: random # * Order bgs will be displayed. 'random" | "reverse" | "id_asc" | "id_desc". Default is the order you specify
  background: 
    global: # Global background settings, if no view is specified, will be applied to all views
      - id: 11.space # ID for a background (Folder name of /gallery/package/ID)
        style: # CSS applied to individual bg's, say if you prefer the bg to be darker, acting like an overlay
        parameters: 
          background-image: black # Example of a parameter thats passed onto a background
    view: # View-specific background settings e.g. http://homeassistant/lovelace/lights - "lights"
      lights: # Settings for the 'lights' view
        - id: 11.space # Identifier for a background
          duration: 40000 
        - id: 15.sound # Identifier for another background
      gruffalo: # e.g. http://homeassistant/lovelace/gruffalo - "gruffalo" etc
        - id: 11.space # Identifier for a background
          duration: 40000
        - id: 15.sound # Identifier for another background
          duration: 40000 

```

The plugin also comes with a card: 

```YAML
type: custom:lovelace-bg-animation
```

![alt text](docs/card.png)


### Offline support

Offline mode was a core feature, however backgrounds (packages) too need to load resources locally for this to work. So the plugin by default is remote (connects to this repos Github page https://ibz0q.github.io/lovelace-bg-animation to download resources).

You can override this by using the below.

```yaml
bg-animation: 
  gallery:
    type: local # * Specifies the type of gallery, 'local' means the gallery is hosted on the same server
    localRootPath: "/local/files/custom" # * If your path uses a different one to HACS or /local for some reason
    remoteRootPath: "" # * Specify your own remote path like the one in this repo
    manifestFileName: "" # * Change the name of the manifest
```

This will tell the plugin to load everything locally. It's also useful if you wish to develop and test your own packages.  

### Adding your own packages 

Everything can be self-contained inside package folder. Instead of using plain HTML files I wanted structure and provide a basic templating and user customizability for users. This ruled out plain HTML files. 

You may see some packages.yaml contain remote scripts like three.js or Stats.js. Please try to inline or locally save assets inside the package folder. If your package has a JS libraries, please load using a relative path and place the JS file inside the root of the package folder. 

Ensure you use this in your package.yaml because it tells the transpiler to include a HTML baseURL tag which is calculated and placed into the background Iframe.

```YAML
helpers:
  insert_baseurl: true
```

Include an SRI hash inside your JS tag so this can be validated. Why- Read security section in contributions.


## Contributions

PRs need to be attached to an issue that contains the following info:

- Image Preview
- name: description: author: source: 
- Does the package contain any of the following?
 - - Javascript,
- -  Uncompiled code like pug, scss
- Have you audited the code yourself?
- Is it safe?

#### Security
 Javascript is allowed and so you must be a reputable user on Github to submit to this repo. Any code that looks to be obfuscated in any way will not be approved. The reason behind this is Home Assistant has quite a big attack surface. We will take steps to minimize risk.
